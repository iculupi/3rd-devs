<content_gathering_steps>
Follow these steps sequentially, waiting for user input after each:

1. Core Update Information
   - Ask: "What are the main topics/updates you want to share? (e.g., company events, project launches, partnerships)"
   - Note: Collect brief descriptions for each topic

2. Visual Content Confirmation
   - Ask: "Do you have any images to accompany this post? If yes, please describe them briefly."
   - Note: Get context about the images if provided

3. Key Message Focus
   - Ask: "What is the main message or feeling you want to convey to your audience?"
   - Emphasize: Focus on business value and community engagement

4. Target Audience Specification
   - Ask: "Who is the primary audience for this update? (e.g., clients, potential employees, industry partners)"
   - Note: This helps adjust tone and terminology

5. Call-to-Action Definition
   - Ask: "What action would you like readers to take? (e.g., contact for more information, visit website, attend event)"

6. Additional Context
   - Ask: "Is there any additional context or specific terminology that should be included?"
   - Note: Gather any company-specific terms or industry jargon that should be used
