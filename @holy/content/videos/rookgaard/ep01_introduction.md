## Video Structure & Full Script

### Opening - Holy Luca (45 seconds)
*[Holy Luca at Temple entrance]*

"Greetings brave adventurers. It is I, Holy Luca, Paladin of Thyria. Today, I do not stand before you as your guide, but I bring forth a trusted companion. One who shall carry the torch and unravel the secrets of Rookgaard, the isle where all journeys begin. Allow me to introduce you to Pardieu, who will now take you through the forgotten tales of this ancient land. Pardieu, the stage is yours."

### Pardieu's Introduction (60 seconds)
*[Character transition to Pardieu]*

"Thank you, Luca, for the trust you've bestowed upon me. I am Pardieu, an adventurer named after a hero from an ancient tale, and today I begin the telling of the island's mysteries. Rookgaard, a place where all newcomers find their first footing, is more than just a training ground. It is a forgotten land steeped in history."

### Central Village Overview (60 seconds)
*[Walking through central locations]*

"In the center stands the temple, our beginning and sanctuary, where new souls awaken. To the north, old Seymour's Academy, where knowledge is passed down. Merchants line the streets, offering their wares, operating in the buildings they added upon their arrival on the island.

To the west of the village lies an exclusive area for premium players, reflecting the elite's division through the concept of taxes in the game lore. To the east, an ancient cemetery which supposedly has not been used for a long time, where we see some terrifying red coat of arms on a black background - just one of many mysteries to be explored."

### Ancient Architecture (90 seconds)
*[Opening minimap to show the five key locations]*

"But before we delve into the present, we must understand the past. Five ancient sites on this island bear witness to a civilization that preceded humanity - the mysterious lizard people. These locations, marked by their distinctive architecture, tell us of a sophisticated culture that once ruled here.

*[Walking to each location as mentioned]*

First, there's the Temple of All Cheese-Eating, an ancient structure now known for its goblin inhabitants. Second, the Rookgaard Temple itself, where traces of lizard architecture blend with human modifications. Third, the main part of the Rookgaard Academy, whose foundations speak of older origins. Fourth, the old cemetery east of the village, where ancient symbols still linger. And fifth, the mountain tower where Hyacinth now resides - an ancient structure whose original purpose remains unknown.

In each of these locations, you can see incredible similarities to the well-known lizard architecture of distant Darama and the huge jungle of Tiquanda. Among the decorations we can distinguish: a small salamander, a three-toed lizard foot, a medusa head as wall decoration and ornament above the entrance.

Were lizards the first colonizers of this small island? Could the signs that we have ignored for so many years show us the true history of this place?"

### Research Approach (60 seconds)
*[Walking through various areas]*

"In addition to architecture, we will also try to look at banners and family coats of arms, interior design, and places that have made bold adventurers dizzy for years. We will also take an in-depth look at botany, geology, and the pantheon of gods who watch over us in this beautiful world, as each of them is said to have made the world we know look the way it does."

### Settlement Waves (45 seconds)
*[Near docks area]*

"Rookgaard is home to a diverse cast of characters, each with their own story. There are traders, soldiers defending the village, and priests guiding the people in their faith. Some arrived on the island seeking fortune, while others have more mysterious origins. They came in waves, and each wave wove a new thread into the magic web of Rookgaard's history."

### Knightmare's Legacy (60 seconds)
*[At a significant location]*

"Before we continue, it is important to acknowledge the role of Knightmare, one of the architects behind the world of Tibia... His clues have guided many adventurers to look beyond the surface.

Thanks to his riddle which we received in the interview and with the help of Holy Luca and the wise druid Stradvarius who solved it.

Thanks to its solution, which is the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen 'The Dream of Little Tuk'. A fairy tale about a boy who has to learn the history and geography of his own country in a lesson the next day.

He reminds us to learn the history of every place we visit, to discover its hidden layers, and to piece together the puzzles that have long remained unsolved.

You can see more details about this in the attached book The true crime story about Dreadeye, Knightmare and Hannibal."

### Closing - Holy Luca (30 seconds)
*[Return to Holy Luca]*

"My deepest thanks to Pardieu for his guidance. This will not be our last meeting, dear friend, for we have many mysteries to explore together. But now, our path branches off, and I shall continue where I can tread. Until we meet again brave adventurers!"
