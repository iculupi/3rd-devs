## NPC Dialogue Structure
- Each NPC has their own text file containing all so far discovered dialogue options
- Dialogues are organized in a Q&A format
- Files are grouped by city/region for easier navigation
- Special locations (like Hellgate) have their own subfolders within city folders

### Dialogue Format Example:
```
Player: [trigger_word]
NPC: [response]
```

## Key Features for Analysis
